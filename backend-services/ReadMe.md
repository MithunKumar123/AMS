Apartment Management System

Purpose of this application is to:

-> Maintain the Apartment by providing the apartment details and Block details
 -> collect the headcount for each month
 -> update the spend for the apartment in this and split it based on the head count received for the month
 -> Other anual charges splitted with the Owners
 -> Association leader and other party people in the apartment would be able to update the details and that will be automatically split to the tenants 
 -> All the people in the apartment will get their specific login. They can login in to that application and pay the amount and they can raise their queires and complaints in this portal.
 -> Only the party people can be able to answer the queries
